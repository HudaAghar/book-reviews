Introduction
============

The reasons I why have read the book<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

State the format of the book. (Teaching? Reference? Methodology? Procedure?)

Summarize the author’s main idea or purpose for writing the book. State what you think their thesis is. 

Additional info (was it a best seller? Did it win any awards?)


Summary
=======
Organize the paragraphs by theme. If there are sections in the book, use them as subheaders.

Cover most interesting areas of the book. Try to summarize a chapter in a few paragraphs as possible.

> Use quotes sparingly, don't quote entire pages from the book

For every chapter try to answer

* what was it about?
* how well does the chapter title describe the overall message of the chapter?
* was the information clearly presented?
* were there actionable items (like "do something before continuing to read" or "for next week, do X") or exercises required?



Conclusion
==========
Your conclusion should wrap up by reviewing the main points of the book and giving your opinion of the book. Did you like it? Was it enjoyable? Do you agree with the author’s ideas or ways of writing? Did you learn something you didn’t know before? Explain your reasons for your reaction, using examples to support your claims.

Questions to ask myself:

*  Is the title accurate and fit the knowledge level of the material presented? 
* What level of experience is needed to effectively use the book? 
* What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the book?
* Who will find the book most useful?
* Is the book technically accurate?
* How clearly is the material presented?
* Are the tables, figures / illustrations appropriate and well executed?  
* Is the depth appropriate for the stated audience?
* Is the material new or present a different approach, or is it a rehash of existing texts?

Imagine your conclusion as a way of telling others whether they should read the book or not. Would they enjoy it? Should they read it? Why or why not?

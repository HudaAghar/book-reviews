Introduction
============

The book claims it's dedicated to all developers who strive for continuous self improvement and not satisfied with good enough. _That's me!_ 

The author wanted to write a guide how to be the most successful software developer in life, not just in programming. 

It also seemed to cover _every_ possible area of life except coding. From career management, writing a blog, creating a product, learning to learn, productivity, finances, real estate, fitness to spirituality. Even though it seemed geared to the developers at the start of their careers, it was interesting to see what there is to learn about soft skills.
 
The book is composed of 7 thematic sections - [Career](#career), [Marketing Yourself](#marketing-yourself), [Learning](#learning), [Productivity](#productivity), [Financial](#financial), [Fitness](#fitness) and [Spirit](#spirit) which have different number of the 71 short chapters there are in the book.

Each section ends with several questions left for the reader to work through. 


Summary
=======

Career
------

The book starts with advice on career building and management - about changing the perception from thinking about yourself in terms of the job you to looking at yourself as a business which offers particular services. How to think like a business - your image and your reputation are your personal brand, your services and know-how is what you sell. 

For people looking for a job, the author suggest for ways they could improve their offering, specialization in particular service or industry. If you're looking for a job, you only really need one client. After thinking about big career goals, they should be broken up into smaller ones, and regularly reviewed.

Getting along with people is essential for any work, as even though we talk to machines, we need to listen to people. Author here recommends [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](#books), and summarizes down to understanding that everyone wants to feel important, rewarding positive behavior works better than criticism and putting yourself in other people's shoes, especially when trying to explain something and avoiding arguments (pick your battles).

Few chapters are mostly for somebody who never worked in the industry, dealing with job interviews and employment possibilities, specialization in programming, different opportunities at small, medium and large companies and ins and outs of working for each one.

On being a professional [_The Art of War_](#books) is quoted
>Turning pro is a mindset. If we are struggling with fear, self-sabotage, procrastination, self-doubt, etc., the problem is, we’re thinking like amateurs. Amateurs don’t show up. Amateurs crap out. Amateurs let adversity defeat them. The pro thinks differently. He shows up, he does his work, he keeps on truckin’, no matter what.

To become a professional we're advised to develop good habits, improve our time management by planning days in advance (the author will later mention [_Getting Things Done_](#books)) and develop and constantly improve sense of workmanship and quality. That helps being able to say "no" where we're asked to do what goes against our better judgement. 
>A professional assesses the work that has to be done, prioritizes it, and gets to work.

Three chapters cover quitting a job, freelancing and founding a startup, with nothing more than a common-sense advice and easily browsable information. 

The chapter on working remotely suggests setting hard hours for work, being realistic about self motivation needed for work when nobody is peeking over your shoulder, and helping ourselves by removing distractions and "doing something for 15 minutes only" which is a hack to get momentum which helps us do more work. Loneliness can be a surprising challenge for some so we could get out, schedule some activities with other people such as programming meetup or anything, really.

Speaking of programming meetups, Chapter #18 has a good advice for a budding programmer - don't get religious about technology. 


Marketing yourself
------------------

Since programmers often frown at the word "marketing", they should understand it's about getting people's attention that matters. Marketing is a multiplier for talent. Whether we realize it or not, we're marketing ourselves all the time, so we should maybe want to do it consciously. And it's all about controlling the message - being aware of how we're presenting ourselves and the image we're portraying.

The ways to market yourself are writing blog posts, recording podcasts or videos, writing magazine articles and books, and speaking at code camps and conferences, but - most importantly - giving something of value to others, answering their problems or providing entertainment, but creating useful, quality content.

> The right way to market yourself is to provide value to others

To create a brand, there's more to it than just a logo, and it's a message, visuals, consistency and repeated exposure. A brand without it's message doesn't have a purpose. 

**Steps for creating a Brand**

* Define your message
* Pick your niche
* Create a tagline
* Create an elevator pitch
* Create visuals

[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) and [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) are recommened for finding freelancers to create design and visuals on the cheap.


The primary goal in all the content production we're advised to do is to add value to others, free of charge. Free content is much more sharable than paid content.

On social networks, we can get people going from followers to fans, where they actively engage with our content and share it with others, but that's not going to happen if we're posting offensive or inane stuff. To stay on top of things, use something like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)

For a successful blog: write consistently and brainstorm topics and ideas ahead of time. For successful public speaking - remember to stay honest and humble.

>Too many people get caught up in being perceived as an expert instead of being honest and humble. Being a real down-to-earth human with real flaws and weaknesses will go a long way to building trust with your audience and will make you seem a lot less like a jerk.

Publishing books and articles has more to do with building reputation than profiting on sales.

We're reminded that to be successful at marketing ourselves we need to overcome the fear of looking like an idiot, which is where most people give up.

> I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. <br>~ Michael Jordan



Learning
--------
>Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.<br>~ Albert Einstein

With tech industry changing rapidly, the best skill we can have is knowing how to learn - being good at teaching ourselves.

Turns out that different learning styles idea is [mostly a myth](http://elearninginfographics.com/the-myth-of-learning-styles-infographic/) and we all learn the best by doing and teaching. Active learning is a much more effective way to learn than any other way.

You could read all the books about riding bicycles, understand all the underlying physical forces, but you'll only learn to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle. Think of playing video games - you only need to know what basic controls are to start playing, everything else you learn by watching others play and occasional referring to the manual as you become more serious.

To learn a technology, there are 3 main things to know

1. How to get started
2. Breadth of the subject
3. The basics - most common use cases<br> (_20% of what you need to know to be 80% effective in using it_)



###10-step system for learning new technologies

For a chosen area of learning, do steps 1-6 once, and then repeat steps 7-10. 

1. Get the big picture<br>_How does this fit in the bigger scheme? What's the 50,000 foot perspective?_
2. Determine scope<br>_Having a reason for learning helps determine scope. Why learn this?<br>Be practical & specific, instead of "learn Java", you can "Learn enough Java to create a multiplatform console application"<br>Adjust focus on time you have, is it weeks or months?_
3. Define success_<br>Imagine how success looks like. Know your target. Come up with a clear and concise statement that defines success for your learning endeavor<br>Instead of "Learn basic iOS development" set a goal of "Build a small iOS app that uses few major platform features"_
4. Find resources_<br>Do your homework, research the topic. Look into books, blog posts, videos, people knowledgeable on the subject, podcasts, source code, example projects, online documentation_
5. Create a learning plan_<br>Break down your learning to smaller chunks, create milestones. Start with looking at chapters of the books on the topic, and modules in workshops or online courses_
6. Filter resources_<br>It's important to narrow your resources down to smaller list of the best ones for practical reasons_
7. Learn enough to get started_<br>Find the quick-start guides, how to make a "hello world", or development environment setup guides. Find enough to be able to play around_
8. Play around_<br>When just reading a book or watching a video about the subject we can absorb too much information, there's no way to tell what's important<br>Play and experiment on your own. Try features out. Create a small project, write down the questions you don't have the answers for and..._
9. Learn enough to do something useful_<br>Hopefully by now you're more curious and particular enough to know to choose to learn more in-depth from your resources<br>Go back to play around when you get deeper insights_
10. Teach_<br>It's a process that will cause you to really dissect and understand the topic you're learning about in your own mind as you organize the information in a way that will make it understandable to other<br>Write an article or create a video, talk to a spouse or a friend, but do take some time to take what you learned from your mind and organize it in a way someone else can understand_
 
Finding a mentor can greatly accelerate your learning. Don't judge too quickly on possible mentors by their own life. Not every sports coach is in a peak physical condition but that doesn't mean they're bad teachers. 

You want to find someone who did what you're trying to do or helped other people to do it. It's important to look at results they have to show and how well do you get along with that person. You can find someone among your family or friends, or someone your friend or family knows. Other places to look for are local software [meetups](http://meetup.com) and local entrepreneurial groups.

It's possible to create a virtual mentor, reading biographies of successful people and having imaginary conversations with them. Seriously :) 

To recruit yourself a mentor, the author suggest you offer free labor. That was the only idea he suggested with "_it's really hard to turn down free labor_", other than being persistent and tenacious.

Further down the learning path, we're suggested to take on the apprentice, in the words of the author "_to become Yoda_". Not just we'd be giving back to the community, it can greatly benefit us. Teaching others is an established way of learning (and it's only enough you're one step ahead of the person you're teaching), and it might well be that someone we're coaching today turns out to be helping us few years later. And you grow when you help others grow.

How to find yourself a _tiny grasshopper_, _a young padawan_? Look among people asking for your help and opinion, but look for someone who has a true desire to learn and is willing to work hard to do it, someone who wants your help to accelerate their progress by benefit of your experience.

Teaching to others is essential to becoming an expert at something. Is there anything you've _mastered_ that you've never taught to anyone else? We all teach others naturally. We usually aren't aware we're teaching. It's just sharing knowledge.  

Teaching takes you from learning something to actually understanding it.

>Trying to teach something to someone else, you force yourself to confront difficult questions about your subject matter and to explore it more deeply until you go from merely learning about a thing to understanding it. Learning tends to be temporary, but understanding is permanent. I can memorize multiplication tables, but if I understand how multiplication works, I can reproduce the tables even if my memory fails me at some point.

**How to teach?** Remember you're trying to help someone else, so it's not about your superiority. Start small (blog, a video, tutorial, a presentation, screencasts, courses)

**Finding gaps in your knowledge** seems like a worthwhile subject. We tend to gloss over our gaps in knowlege and we tend to be too busy to stop and take time to fill them in We end up not really understanding whaat we're doing or do things in an inefficient way to avoid areas where we're weak or feel uncomfortable. Look where you're spending the largest amount of time and any repeated tasks you're doing. Do you know most common keyboard shortcuts for an application you use every day?

A good way to keep track of gaps in your knowledge is to keep a lists of things you need to research or aren't clear about. Keep track of the same items that keep coming up. Don't be embarrassed to ask questions when you don't understand something.

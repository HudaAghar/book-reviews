John is a founder of [http://simpleprogrammer.com/](http://simpleprogrammer.com/) a blog turned developer-coaching and education consultancy. He's also a real-estate agent, course author, technical consultant, former aspiring model and has retired when he was 33 years old<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. 



Introduction
============

The book claims it's dedicated to all developers who strive for continuous self improvement and not satisfied with good enough. _That's me!_ 

The author wanted to write a guide how to be the most successful software developer in life, not just in programming. _That's what I aspire to!!_

It also seemed to cover _every_ possible area of life except coding. From career management, writing a blog, creating a product, learning to learn, productivity, finances, real estate, fitness to spirituality. Even though it seemed geared to the developers at the start of their careers, I wanted to see what else I could learn.
 
The book is composed of 7 thematic sections - [Career](#career), [Marketing Yourself](#marketing-yourself), [Learning](#learning), [Productivity](#productivity), [Financial](#financial), [Fitness](#fitness) and [Spirit](#spirit) which have different number of the 71 short chapters there are in the book.

Each section ends with several questions left for the reader to work through. 


Summary
=======

Career
------

The book starts with advice on career building and management - about changing the perception from thinking about yourself in terms of the job you to looking at yourself as a business which offers particular services.**How to think like a business?** - your image and your reputation are your personal brand, your services and know-how is what you sell. 

**For people looking for a job**, the author suggest for ways they could improve their offering, specialization in particular service or industry. If you're looking for a job, you only really need one client. After thinking about big career goals, they should be broken up into smaller ones, and regularly reviewed.

**Getting along with people** is essential for any work, as even though we talk to machines, we need to listen to people. Author here recommends [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](#books), and summarizes down to understanding that everyone wants to feel important, rewarding positive behavior works better than criticism and putting yourself in other people's shoes, especially when trying to explain something and avoiding arguments (pick your battles).

Few chapters are mostly for somebody who never worked in the industry, dealing with job interviews and employment possibilities, specialization in programming, different opportunities at small, medium and large companies and ins and outs of working for each one.

On being a professional [_The Art of War_](#books) is quoted
>Turning pro is a mindset. If we are struggling with fear, self-sabotage, procrastination, self-doubt, etc., the problem is, we’re thinking like amateurs. Amateurs don’t show up. Amateurs crap out. Amateurs let adversity defeat them. The pro thinks differently. He shows up, he does his work, he keeps on truckin’, no matter what.

To become a professional we're advised to develop good habits, improve our time management by planning days in advance (the author will later mention [_Getting Things Done_](#books)) and develop and constantly improve sense of workmanship and quality. That helps being able to say "no" where we're asked to do what goes against our better judgement. 
>A professional assesses the work that has to be done, prioritizes it, and gets to work.

Three chapters cover quitting a job, freelancing and founding a startup, with nothing more than a common-sense advice and easily browsable information. 

The chapter on working remotely suggests setting hard hours for work, being realistic about self motivation needed for work when nobody is peeking over your shoulder, and helping ourselves by removing distractions and "doing something for 15 minutes only" which is a hack to get momentum which helps us do more work. Loneliness can be a surprising challenge for some so we could get out, schedule some activities with other people such as programming meetup or anything, really.

Speaking of programming meetups, Chapter #18 has a good advice for a budding programmer - don't get religious about technology. Stop the (hate) wars. 


Marketing yourself
------------------

Since programmers often frown at the word "marketing", they should understand it's about getting people's attention that matters. Marketing is a multiplier for talent. Whether we realize it or not, we're marketing ourselves all the time, so we should maybe want to do it consciously. And it's all about controlling the message - being aware of how we're presenting ourselves and the image we're portraying.

The ways to market yourself are writing blog posts, recording podcasts or videos, writing magazine articles and books, and speaking at code camps and conferences, but - most importantly - giving something of value to others, answering their problems or providing entertainment, but creating useful, quality content.

> The right way to market yourself is to provide value to others

To create a brand, there's more to it than just a logo, and it's a message, visuals, consistency and repeated exposure. A brand without it's message doesn't have a purpose. 

**Steps for creating a Brand**

* Define your message
* Pick your niche
* Create a tagline
* Create an elevator pitch
* Create visuals

[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) and [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) are recommened for finding freelancers to create design and visuals on the cheap.


The primary goal in all the content production we're advised to do is to add value to others, free of charge. Free content is much more sharable than paid content.

On social networks, we can get people going from followers to fans, where they actively engage with our content and share it with others, but that's not going to happen if we're posting offensive or inane stuff. To stay on top of things, use something like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/)

For a successful blog: write consistently and brainstorm topics and ideas ahead of time. For successful public speaking - remember to stay honest and humble.

>Too many people get caught up in being perceived as an expert instead of being honest and humble. Being a real down-to-earth human with real flaws and weaknesses will go a long way to building trust with your audience and will make you seem a lot less like a jerk.

Publishing books and articles has more to do with building reputation than profiting on sales.

We're reminded that to be successful at marketing ourselves we need to overcome the fear of looking like an idiot, which is where most people give up.

> I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. <br>~ Michael Jordan



Learning
--------
>Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.<br>~ Albert Einstein

With tech industry changing rapidly, the best skill we can have is knowing how to learn - being good at teaching ourselves.

Turns out that different learning styles idea is [mostly a myth](http://elearninginfographics.com/the-myth-of-learning-styles-infographic/) and we all learn the best by doing and teaching. Active learning is a much more effective way to learn than any other way.

You could read all the books about riding bicycles, understand all the underlying physical forces, but you'll only learn to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle. Think of playing video games - you only need to know what basic controls are to start playing, everything else you learn by watching others play and occasional referring to the manual as you become more serious.

To learn a technology, there are 3 main things to know

1. How to get started
2. Breadth of the subject
3. The basics - most common use cases<br> (_20% of what you need to know to be 80% effective in using it_)



###10-step system for learning new technologies

For a chosen area of learning, do steps 1-6 once, and then repeat steps 7-10. 

1. Get the big picture<br>_How does this fit in the bigger scheme? What's the 50,000 foot perspective?_
2. Determine scope<br>_Having a reason for learning helps determine scope. Why learn this?<br>Be practical & specific, instead of "learn Java", you can "Learn enough Java to create a multiplatform console application"<br>Adjust focus on time you have, is it weeks or months?_
3. Define success<br>_Imagine how success looks like. Know your target. Come up with a clear and concise statement that defines success for your learning endeavor<br>Instead of "Learn basic iOS development" set a goal of "Build a small iOS app that uses few major platform features"_
4. Find resources<br>_Do your homework, research the topic. Look into books, blog posts, videos, people knowledgeable on the subject, podcasts, source code, example projects, online documentation_
5. Create a learning plan<br>_Break down your learning to smaller chunks, create milestones. Start with looking at chapters of the books on the topic, and modules in workshops or online courses_
6. Filter resources<br>_It's important to narrow your resources down to smaller list of the best ones for practical reasons_
7. Learn enough to get started<br>_Find the quick-start guides, how to make a "hello world", or development environment setup guides. Find enough to be able to play around_
8. Play around<br>_When just reading a book or watching a video about the subject we can absorb too much information, there's no way to tell what's important<br>Play and experiment on your own. Try features out. Create a small project, write down the questions you don't have the answers for and..._
9. Learn enough to do something useful<br>_Hopefully by now you're more curious and particular enough to know to choose to learn more in-depth from your resources<br>Go back to play around when you get deeper insights_
10. Teach<br>_It's a process that will cause you to really dissect and understand the topic you're learning about in your own mind as you organize the information in a way that will make it understandable to other<br>Write an article or create a video, talk to a spouse or a friend, but do take some time to take what you learned from your mind and organize it in a way someone else can understand_
 
**Finding a mentor** can greatly accelerate your learning. Don't judge too quickly on possible mentors by their own life. Not every sports coach is in a peak physical condition but that doesn't mean they're bad teachers. 

You want to find someone who did what you're trying to do or helped other people to do it. It's important to look at results they have to show and how well do you get along with that person. You can find someone among your family or friends, or someone your friend or family knows. Other places to look for are local software [meetups](http://meetup.com) and local entrepreneurial groups.

To recruit yourself a mentor, the author suggest you offer free labor. That was the only idea he suggested with "_it's really hard to turn down free labor_", other than being persistent and tenacious. Being a sufficient pain in the butt could work too. 

If you can't find a mentor for the purpose of specific learning (Nikola Tesla and Alan Turing are not available, for example), like [Napoleon Hill](#books) - read biographies of great people and have imaginary conversations with them. Seriously 😁

Further down the learning path, we're suggested to **take on the apprentice**, in the words of the author "_to become Yoda_". Not just we'd be giving back to the community, it can greatly benefit us. Teaching others is an established way of learning (and it's only enough you're one step ahead of the person you're teaching), and it might well be that someone we're coaching today turns out to be helping us few years later. And - **you grow when you help others grow**.

How to find yourself a _tiny grasshopper_, _a young padawan_? Look among people asking for your help and opinion, but look for someone who has a true desire to learn and is willing to work hard to do it, someone who wants your help to accelerate their progress by benefit of your experience.

**Teaching to others** is essential to becoming an expert at something. Is there anything you've _mastered_ that you've never taught to anyone else, at least partially? We all teach others naturally. We usually aren't aware we're teaching - it's just sharing knowledge.  

Teaching takes you from learning something to actually understanding it.

>Trying to teach something to someone else, you force yourself to confront difficult questions about your subject matter and to explore it more deeply until you go from merely learning about a thing to understanding it. Learning tends to be temporary, but understanding is permanent. I can memorize multiplication tables, but if I understand how multiplication works, I can reproduce the tables even if my memory fails me at some point.

**How to teach?** Remember you're trying to help someone else, so it's not about your superiority. Start small (blog, a video, tutorial, a presentation, screencasts, courses)

**Finding gaps in your knowledge** seems like a worthwhile subject. We tend to gloss over our gaps in knowledge and we tend to be too busy to stop and take time to fill them in. _We end up not really understanding what we're doing or do things in an inefficient way to avoid areas where we're weak or feel uncomfortable._ Look where you're spending the largest amount of time and any repeated tasks you're doing. Do you know most common keyboard shortcuts for an application you use every day?

A good way to keep track of gaps in your knowledge is to keep a lists of things you need to research or aren't clear about. Keep track of the same items that keep coming up. Don't be embarrassed to ask questions when you don't understand something.
 
Productivity
------------

> Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.<br>~ Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft

**Focus** is the most important part of being productive. And focus is the opposite of distraction. Context-switching, which we perform while trying to multitask is very detrimental to our overall performance<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>. 

> Without focus, tasks end up getting stretched out over a long period of time.

How to get in the focused state? Start working on something that you estimate will take 15-30 minutes. Remove all distractions, resist the urge to check your email, IM, FB, Twitter, phone, etc. The momentum you build up in the first 5-10 minutes will help you stay focused. 

**The Author's personal productivity plan** is a blend of [Getting Things Done](#books), [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and Seinfeld's "[Don't break the chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)". He plans his week in advance using a [Kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board). He divides the year to quarters and dedicates each quarter to a big project, plus several smaller ones, and plans ahead on weekly (using the Kanban board) and monthly (using a calendar) basis<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>. He plans every day in the morning, by moving the prepared tasks to "today" column on his modified Kanban board - he works on most interesting or most important task first.

The author schedules daily work in 25 minute long "*pomodori*" and estimates to get around 10 *pomodori* a day - each one is a 25 minute long uninterrupted focused work, and not easily achievable. That requires thoughtful dealing with distractions - make it clear to other people there are times you need to focus to get your work done, you can reply to that text or email in 25 minutes. For breaks and vacations he has some _free_ weeks, where he doesn't schedule the time with _pomodoris_.

> If you’re going to adopt this technique, make sure you have a realistic expectation of what you can actually accomplish. Just because you work 40 hours in a week doesn’t mean you can get 80 pomodori done. (If you’re able to achieve that feat, I’d be utterly amazed, and, quite honestly, would fear for your mental health.)

When he started **using quotas**, the author managed to level up his productivity

>I started applying a weekly quota of doing one blog post per week and added quotas for other things I wanted to make sure I got done regularly, like creating YouTube videos and podcasts. I created a quota for everything I did that I needed to do more than once. I quantified exactly how frequently I’d do any repeatable task. It could be once a month, four times a week, or twice a day. If I was going to repeat it, I was going to define how often, and I was going to make a commitment about it. Rain or shine, I was going to do what I committed to. I took these quotas very seriously.

The commitment to quotas is essential, it helps to be realistic and practical when setting ones for yourself - if the quota is too high, don't quit mid-way. Finish the quota for the week and then decrease it. 

* Pick a repeatable task. 
* Define an interval in which that task must be done and repeated. 
* Define a quota for how many times the task should be done during a given interval. 
* Commit. Make a firm commitment to meet your quota. 
* Adjust. Make your quota higher or lower, but don’t adjust during an interval.

Make it a thing to **be accountable to yourself**. The motivation can be _external_ or _internal_. The author here recommends [Daniel Pink’s book Drive](#books) There's no hard advice here - you need to create rules how you'd like to live your life, especially around areas critical to your success. It can help imagining yourself as a video game character and imagine the life you'd like to lay out for that character. The author suggests that external help like an accountabilibuddy, supporting group, making your actions as public as possible<sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup>.

>It’s important to develop a sense of self-accountability to be productive when no one is looking. You could also call this having character or integrity, because they’re all part of the same idea. Without this sense of accountability to yourself, you’re always dependent on external motivations to get you to perform. You become easily manipulated by a carrot promising a reward or a stick promising...a beating if you fall out of line.

Talking about **multitasking** and how generally bad it is (breaking the flow, cost of context switching, etc), the Author suggests _batching_ instead<sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup>. Interesting argument presented in the chapter is about _true_ multitasking<sup>[6](#footnote6)</sup>; doing two mentally taxing things at once is impossible to do well, but doing a _physically_ engaged and _mentally_ engaged task simultaneously is quite easy - listening to an audiobook while driving, for example, or listening to instrumental music while writing, reading your email while walking on a treadmill, etc. 

**Chapter 42. on burnout** is imho the worst chapter in the book. The Author seems to be confusing burnout with "hitting a wall", so his advice is "just stick with it". Which makes sense when you hit a wall - your product is not taking off, you become disillusioned with your job, you leave your book half written - so you should stick with that and break through the wall<sup>[7](#footnote7)</sup>. But burnout is more like hitting ground after deorbiting, burning out in the atmosphere before exploding upon hitting the ground. Burnout requires a person to step back and take a break, probably get some help - before it makes more damage. Burnout can kill you. Burnout is [Karōshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kar%C5%8Dshi).

**Talking about wasting time** comes down to "Don't watch TV" & tracking your time to identify the bigger time wasters (commonly social media, news sites, unnecessary meetings, cooking, video games, etc). 

**The chapter on routine** reveals the power of little incremental effort. With full time jobs most people have 4-6 free hours in a day, which is most time they can dedicate to routine(s). A list of daily activities is enough to implement, and remember to be flexible enough to accept the unexpected events. 

>Write 1,000 words a day, every day, and in a year you’ll have written four novels. (The average novel is between 60,000 and 80,000 words.)

Following is the **topic of habits** which fits nicely after talking about routines :) Author here mentions [The Power of Habit](#books) and summarizes habits of being 3-part, consisting of

1. cue
2. routine
3. reward<sup>[8](#footnote8)</sup>

The key is to **identify bad habits**, and ideally, use them to replace them with good ones (_a twofer!_)<sup>[9](#footnote9)</sup>. To find the bad habits, look into things you do that make you feel guilty, what is it that you want to stop doing, but keep putting off? Start small, find a single habit, figure out it's triggers and you'll be able to break it or use the triggers to install a better routine for your habit. It takes time. To form an entirely new habit, stick with it long enough<sup>[10](#footnote10)</sup><sup>, [11](#footnote11)</sup> and figure out a reward (e.g. 5 min break, playing a game for a limited time) & cue (what triggers the habit? - time it regularly, use reminders or piggyback on another habit).


> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.<br>~ Aristotle

**Chapter 46. "Breaking down things"** describes project planning (breaking a big task in bunch of smaller ones) basically deals with piecemeal approach to the bigger projects, to help against procrastination. 
>How to eat an elephant?<br>When eating an elephant take one bite at a time.<br>~ Creighton Abrams

**Why is hard work hard?** We tend to think that of work that is likely to benefit us. No matter how smart you work, there's no substitute for hard work<sup>[12](#footnote12)</sup>. Like _Nike_ says - "Just do it!"

>The race is to the driven, not to the swift.<br>~ John Jakes, North and South

**Any action is better than no action.** What prevents us from action is mostly fear. Fear of unknown, fear of failure, fear of not knowing enough, fear of not being up to it. Don't die like the donkey that couldn't decide between two stacks of hay. Pick one and if you're going in the wrong direction, adjust accordingly. 

> Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something, in which case it’s no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing.<br>Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now

### Checklist for taking action

* What specifically is holding me back from taking action?
* If there is a choice I need to make, what is that choice? What options do I have to choose from?
* What’s the worst that can result from making a wrong choice?
* If I choose wrong, can I go back and try another choice? Will the cost of doing so be high?
* Is there a big difference between the choices? Can I get away with a suboptimal solution that I can take action on right away?
* Does the problem I’m facing lend itself to self-discoverability? If I start taking some action, will I be able to course-correct until I eventually find the right action to take?
* What will happen if I don’t take any action? What will the cost be in time, missed opportunity, or money?



Financial
---------

This section comes goes in describing retirement funds<sup>[13](#footnote13)</sup>, negotiating your salary, stocks & options trading, real estate market, and the dangers of being in debt. It's geared towards software developers as likely to earn relatively big salaries. 

Most of this section deals in very specific areas rather superficially, letting the reader know general ins and outs of particular field to start actually learning more on their own, and ends with a chapter about the author retiring at 33 years old.

This last, biographical chapter, gets very TV-salesman-y in which the author figures out that _technically_ retirement means if you have passive income which exceeds your expenses, you are officially retired. 

He started with selling gumball machines, and proceeded to get into real estate business and buys several rental properties which he'll cash out in 20 or 30 years after paying out a loan, and in the mean time covers his expenses by rent charged by the residents.<sup>[14](#footnote14)</sup> 

Most of the general advice the author lifted from [Robert Kiyosaki](#books) on _assets_ vs _liabilities_

> An asset is something that has a higher utility value than what its maintenance cost is. That means that for something to qualify as an asset, it has to be able to provide more dollars of value than it costs to own.<br>A liability, on the other hand, is just the opposite. It’s something that costs more than the value it provides. To keep the liability around, you have to shell out money, but you could never get as much money as you’re shelling out.

| Assets                  | Liabilities               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dividend stocks         | Credit card debt          |
| Rental real estate      | House (if too big)        |
| Bonds                   | Car (if too much)         |
| Music royalty rights    | Monthly services          |
| Software royalty rights | Equipment that loses value over time|



Fitness
-------

> The human body is the best picture of the human soul.<br>Ludwig Wittgenstein<sup>[15](#footnote15)</sup>


Spirit
------

* what was it about?
* how well does the chapter title describe the overall message of the chapter?
* was the information clearly presented?
* were there actionable items (like "do something before continuing to read" or "for next week, do X") or exercises required?



Conclusion
==========
Your conclusion should wrap up by reviewing the main points of the book and giving your opinion of the book. Did you like it? Was it enjoyable? Do you agree with the author’s ideas or ways of writing? Did you learn something you didn’t know before? Explain your reasons for your reaction, using examples to support your claims.

Questions to ask myself:

*  Is the title accurate and fit the knowledge level of the material presented? 
* What level of experience is needed to effectively use the book? 
* What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the book?
* Who will find the book most useful?
* Is the book technically accurate?
* How clearly is the material presented?
* Are the tables, figures / illustrations appropriate and well executed?  
* Is the depth appropriate for the stated audience?
* Is the material new or present a different approach, or is it a rehash of existing texts?

Imagine your conclusion as a way of telling others whether they should read the book or not. Would they enjoy it? Should they read it? Why or why not?
